# Craig Beveridge
**Front-End–First Full-Stack Developer | Contract Software Engineer**  
Designing scalable, maintainable, and user-centred web systems.

## Summary
Versatile engineer with a track record of transforming complex or legacy products into clean, modular systems.  
I specialise in **front-end architecture, UX consistency, and long-term maintainability** — using whatever tech stack fits the problem.  
Equally comfortable designing component frameworks, streamlining build pipelines, or bridging UI and backend logic.  

I value **clarity**: my work focuses on patterns that scale, stay readable, and minimise regression risk.

## Core Strengths
- **Front-End Architecture:** modular frameworks, component design, event-driven state management.  
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** applying SOLID and DRY principles to reduce coupling and simplify future change.  
- **System Thinking:** designing boundaries that make refactoring and integration low-risk.  
- **User Experience & Accessibility:** clean, predictable interfaces that align with product goals.  
- **Cross-Stack Adaptability:** experienced across JS/TS, HTML/CSS, Node, .NET, and legacy ASP.NET systems.  
- **Collaboration & Mentorship:** clear communication with designers, PMs, and developers across disciplines.

## Selected Project Highlights
**Legacy System Modernisation**  
Refactored a clinician-built secondary-care application with heavy jQuery and Web Forms into a modular architecture.  
Introduced a component-based front-end layer, event publishing/subscription for live updates, and structured services for data access.
Introduced a streamlined branching and frequent release strategy that improved delivery cadence and reduced deployment friction.  
→ Outcome: Faster feature delivery and reduced QA regression load.

**Custom Front-End Framework**  
Created a lightweight JavaScript component framework using Shadow DOM encapsulation and Bootstrap theming.  
Structured it around a shared core and feature modules with a multi-entrypoint bundler setup (Vite/Rollup).  
→ Outcome: Reuse across multiple pages, single load per session, and consistent style isolation.

**Workflow / Task Application**  
Developed event-driven UI behaviour for synchronising task lifecycle updates across machines using publish/subscribe mechanics.  
→ Outcome: Real-time collaboration and simplified extension for new task types.

## 💬 Approach & Philosophy

- Start from system boundaries and data flow, not frameworks.  
- Prefer clear contracts and predictable behaviour over deep abstractions.  
- Introduce structure gradually in legacy systems to avoid disruption.  
- Optimise for readability, testability, and future extension.
